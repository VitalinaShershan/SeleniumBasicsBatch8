Class 11

Upload documents:
In order for us to upload documents using selenium we can simply do sendKeys(filePath);

If sendKeys does not work, you can use Robot class.

JS Executor:
It is something that is present in our selenium tool and can be executed in different programming languages
(java, C#, python etc.)
JavaScriptExecutor is an interface.

We should only be using JavaScriptExecutor only when we are not able to perfrom some actions such as:
Click on elements
Scroll the page
refresh the page
highlight the element
scroll to a specific element

What is POM?
Page Object Model
It is a design pattern which is mainly used to enhance test maintenance and reduce code duplication

POM can be implemented in 2 ways:
1. POM without PageFactory
2. POM with PageFactory

PageFactory is a class which gives us an opportunity to interact with our stored elements inside each page class
